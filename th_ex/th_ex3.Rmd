# 1. Overview

In this take-home exercise 3, we are going to reveal the **economic** of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA by using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods. We will show how the financial health of the residents changes over the period of time and how the wages are compared against overall cost of living.

The data is processed by using appropriate tidyverse family of packages, whereas the statistical graphics are prepared using ggplot2 and its extensions.

# 2. Getting Started

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The packages required for this exercise are [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [**ggiraph**](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/), [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/), [**gganimate**](https://gganimate.com/),
[**zoo**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/zoo.pdf), [**trelliscopejs**](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/index.html) and [**gifski**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/index.html).

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse','ggiraph','plotly','gganimate','zoo','trelliscopejs','gifski')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# 3. Data

### 3.1 Data Source
The original dataset was obtained from [*VAST Challenge 2022*](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/index.html) in csv format. It shows the financial report of 1011 residents of Engagement, OH that have agreed to participate in this study from March 2022 until May 2023.

### 3.2 Importing Data
The code chunk below imports a dataset called *FinancialJournal.csv* into R by using `read_csv()` of **readr** and saves it as tibble data frame called *financial*. It consists of 1,856,330 records as shown below.

```{r}
financial <- read_csv("data/FinancialJournal.csv")
head(financial)
```

### 3.3 Data Wrangling

As we are not interested in time, we will only pick up the month and year by using `as.yearmon()` of **zoo** and rename the new column as yearmonth. 

The financial journal consists of 6 categories namely Education, Food, Recreation, Rent Adjustment, Shelter and Wage. We are going to sum them up and group them by participant ID, yearmonth and category. 

```{r}
financial <- financial %>%
  mutate(yearmonth = as.yearmon(timestamp)) %>%
  group_by(participantId, yearmonth, category) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(amount))
head(financial)
```

In this code chunk below, we are going to create a new table called *expenses* to reveal the living cost of the residents by excluding Wage and Rent Adjustment from category column.

```{r}
expenses <- financial %>%
  filter(category != 'Wage') %>%
  filter(category != 'RentAdjustment')
```

Next, we are going to use `pivot_wider()` of **dplyr** to create new columns based on the amount of each category, and rename the new table as *fin_wide*.

We will also strip all NA values by specifying `na.rm = TRUE` and calculate the living cost, revenue and savings.

**Living cost = Education + Food + Recreation + Shelter**

**Revenue = Wage + Rent Adjustment**

**Savings = Revenue - Living cost**

```{r}
fin_wide <- financial %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "category",
              values_from = "Total") %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(LivingCost = sum(c_across(c(1:4)),na.rm=T)) %>%
  mutate(Revenue = sum(c_across(c(5:6)),na.rm=T)) %>%
  mutate(Savings = sum(c_across(c(7:8)),na.rm=T))
head(fin_wide)
```

# 4. Economic Visualisation

## Financial Health of Residents 

Trellis display below shows how monthly savings of each participant change from March 2022 to May 2023. 

```{r}
qplot(yearmonth, Savings, data = fin_wide) +
  labs(x = "Year & Month",
       y = "Savings") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_trelliscope(~ participantId,
                    nrow = 2, ncol = 5,
                    width = 450,
                    path = "trellis/",
                    self_contained = TRUE)
```

## Overview of Living Costs and Revenue

From the graph below, it is noticed that there is a major shift from the top right hand corner towards the bottom left hand corner. In general, both revenue and living costs are getting lower.

```{r}
ggplot(fin_wide %>% mutate(yearmonth = as.numeric(yearmonth)),
       aes(x = Revenue, y = LivingCost*-1, 
           size = Revenue, 
           colour = participantId)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(100)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = 'Revenue ($)',
       y = 'Living Costs ($)') +
  transition_time(yearmonth) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

## Monthly Expenses Distribution

On average, residents allocate most of their monthly revenue for shelter, followed by recreation, food and lastly education.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = expenses,
       aes(x = category, y = Total*-1))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Category") +
  ylab("Amount ($)") +
  ggtitle("Monthly Expenses Distribution")
ggplotly(p)
```

## Changes in Living Costs and Wage in More Detail

Let us now examine how wages and each daily expense other than shelter change from March 2022 to May 2023 in more detail. While the wages are shrinking, it is also found that the education and recreation cost are getting lower in May 2023.

If we look further into the second graph, we could also see that in March 2022 there are 2 distinct groups of participants. One group has relatively lower wages and lower food expenses, while the other group has higher wages as well as higher food expenses. However, in May 2023 they become homogeneous.
