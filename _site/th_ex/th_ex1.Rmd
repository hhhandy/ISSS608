# 1. Overview

In this take-home exercise, we are going to reveal the demographic of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA by using appropriate static statistical graphics methods.

The data is processed by using appropriate tidyverse family of packages, whereas the statistical graphics are prepared using ggplot2 and its extensions.

### INTERESTING FACT

Engagement city does not physically exist in Google Maps. It often refers to Urbana which is located halfway between Dayton and Marion (dating and marrying). Source: [*Barry Popik*](https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/ohio_wheres_engagement)

# 2. Getting Started

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The packages required for this exercise are [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) and [**hrbrthemes**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/hrbrthemes/versions/0.1.0).

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse','ggdist','hrbrthemes')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# 3. Data

### DATA SOURCE
The original dataset was obtained from [*VAST Challenge 2022*](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/index.html) in csv format. It consists of basic information about the residents of Engagement, OH that have agreed to participate in
this study.

### IMPORTING DATA
The code chunk below imports dataset into R by using `read_csv()` of **readr** and saves it as a tibble data frame called *demographics*. It consists of 1011 records as shown below.

```{r}
demographics <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")
glimpse(demographics)
```

### DATA WRANGLING

For easier understanding, the age distribution of the population is further split into 4 broad age groups of similar distribution, namely 30 and below, 31-40, 41-50, and 51 and above.

To do this, `mutate()` of **dplyr** adds a new variable called *age_category* while still preserves the existing variables - *age*.

```{r}
demographics <- demographics %>%
  mutate(age_category=cut(age, 
                          breaks=c(17, 30, 40, 50, 60),
                          labels=c('30 and below','31-40','41-50','51 and above')))
```

# 4. Demographic Visualisation

### STATIC STATISTICAL GRAPH METHODS
Basic statistical graphs are derived from [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html), such as `geom_bar()` to create a bar chart, `geom_histogram()` to create a histogram, `geom_text()` to display a text, `geom_hline()` to create a horizontal line, and `coord_flip()` to rotate vertical plots into horizontal plots. 

Next, we also explore and go beyond basic statistical graphs by using [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) package, such as `stat_halfeye()` to create a half violin plot, as well as `stat_dots()`.

The label on x-axis, label on y-axis and title are set by `xlab()`, `ylab()` and `ggtitle()` respectively, whereas the base theme used below is `theme_ipsum()` of [**hrbrthemes**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/hrbrthemes/versions/0.1.0) which is an Arial Narrow-based theme.

See Appendix section for more details.

### MARITAL STATUS AND KIDS
Out of 1011 Engagement residents participated in this study, about 70% of them do not have kids. 
Furthermore, the second graph shows that among these 710 residents without kids, 337 of them are currently single.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = demographics,
       aes(x = haveKids)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label=..count..),
            stat="count",
            vjust=1.5,
            color="white") +
  xlab("Residents Have Kids") +
  ylab("No. of\nResidents") +
  ggtitle("Only 30% of Engagement Residents Have Kids",
          subtitle = "A survey of 1011 Residents Taken in 2022") +
  theme_ipsum(plot_title_size = 14,
              axis_title_face = 24,
              base_size=10,
              grid="Y")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = demographics,
       aes(x = householdSize)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label=..count..),
            stat="count",
            vjust=1.5,
            color="white") +
  xlab("Household Size (Persons)") +
  ylab("No. of\nResidents") +
  ggtitle("Most of Households Consist of 2 Person",
          subtitle = "A survey of 1011 Residents Taken in 2022") +
  theme_ipsum(plot_title_size = 14,
              axis_title_face = 24,
              base_size=10,
              grid="Y")
```

### HOW HAPPY ARE ENGAGEMENT RESIDENTS?

Two figures below show the happiness level across different age groups and education levels.

It is observed that the happiness level is almost equally distributed among young adults aged 30 and below, while on the other hand, most of the elderlies seem to be unhappy.
In addition, unhappiness is also associated with low-educated residents.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = demographics,
       aes(x = joviality*100))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20) +
  facet_grid(~ age_category) +
  xlab("Happiness Level Percentage") +
  ylab("No. of\nResidents") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,50,100)) +
  ggtitle("Elderlies are Getting Unhappy",
          subtitle="Happiness Level Across Different Age Groups") +
  theme_ipsum(plot_title_size = 14,
              axis_title_face = 24,
              strip_text_size = 10,
              base_size=10,
              plot_margin = margin(5,5,5,5))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data=demographics, 
       aes(x = educationLevel, y = joviality*100)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 50), 
                     limits = c(0, 100)) + 
  stat_halfeye(adjust = .33, 
               width = .67, 
               color = NA,
               justification = -.01,
               position = position_nudge(
                 x = .15)) + 
  stat_dots(side = "left", 
            justification = 1.1, 
            binwidth = .25,
            dotsize = 5) +
  xlab("Education Level") +
  ylab("Happiness Level Percentage") +
  ggtitle("Low-educated Residents Tend to be Unhappy",
          subtitle="Happiness Level Across Different Education Levels") +
  theme_ipsum(plot_title_size = 14,
              axis_title_face = 24,
              strip_text_size = 10,
              base_size=10) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mean(joviality,
                                 na.rm=T)*100),
             color="red", 
             linetype="dashed", 
             size=0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(4.5,mean(joviality)*100,
                label="Average", vjust=-0.5), size=3)+
  coord_flip()
```
