# 1. Overview

In this take-home exercise 5, we are going to reveal the **social areas** of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA and visualise **location with traffic bottleneck** by using appropriate visual analytics methods.

The data is processed by using appropriate tidyverse family of packages, whereas the statistical graphics are prepared using tmap and its extensions.

# 2. Getting Started

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The packages required for this exercise are **tidyverse**, **sf**, **tmap**, **lubridate** and **clock**.

```{r}
packages = c('sf', 'tidyverse','tmap','lubridate','clock')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
