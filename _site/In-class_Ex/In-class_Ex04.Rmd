# 1. Getting Started

## Setting up R packages

To start with, [**ggstatplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) and [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages will be launched using `library()`.

```{r}
packages = c('ggstatsplot', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
}
```

## Importing Data

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# 2. Working with ggstatplot

## ANOVA test

Here, `ggbetweenstats()` is used to build a visual for one-way ANOVA test on English score by race.
*Nonparametric* statistical approach is used as data is assumed to not conform to normality assumption.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 8}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "np"
)
```

Set.seed() function is used when we are using *Bayesian* approach to generate the same result everytime we run the code chunk.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 8}
set.seed(1234)

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes"
)
```
